# Final Project Team G

### Authors
Lizzie Collins, Christopher Davis, Alexis Evans, and Aja Moore

### Summary
An RPG battle where the user can choose and edit their character, select battle enemy difficulty, and fight enemy characters. The game will display visual menus, buttons, stats, and graphics for the user to navigate through. 

### Needed
- IntelliJ Idea
- JavaFX

### Iteration 1
During this implementation, the following classes below were created and shows description of what each set of the classes do.


### Classes Created: 
- <p> Battle Menu (Sets the battle up for the player. Once the player completes the battle, redirects to EndCard class.) <br>

- <p> EndCard (Once the player is finished battling, results will show victory or defeat, after the score is displayed, they have an option to exit the game, restart the battle, or go back to main menu to create a new player.) <br>

- <p> Main (Runs the code through this class). <br>

- <p> Menu (When you run the program, a menu will pop up with the options of difficulty and playerEdit.) <br>

- <p> PlayerChoiceMenu (The option for the player to select a customize player.) <br>

- <p> PlayerEditMenu (The option for the player to customize their players.) <br>

- <p> DifficultyMenu (The option for the player to select their difficulty.) <br>


### Iteration 2
This iteration was implementation of test classes and a package that were created for the menus to display on the program. 

### Test Classes Created: 
- <p> PlayerSelectionTest (A menu that pops up for the player to pick a character within the selection provided.) <br>

- <p> EnemyDisplayTest (A PNG image the displays for the player to see their enemy on their screen, making this a visual appealing effect for the player.) <br>

- <p> DifficultyMenuTest (A menu that displays a selection of difficulties for the player to pick.) <br>

### Package Created: Combat
<p> Classes Created Inside Of Combat:
  
- <p> BattleLogic (The algorithm of how the combat works.) <br>
  
- <p> CharacterBase (The system that reads the data of the players name, hp, and damage; and also giving the options to attack and defend.) <br>

- <p> DifficultySelection (A system that is set up for the player to see the difficulty selection, choosing the options "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard".) <br>

- <p> EnemyEasy (A system that is implemented in the program for the enemy to be on easy.) <br>

- <p> EnemyMedium (A system that is implemented in the program for the enemy to be on medium.) <br>

- <p> EnemyHard (A system that is implemented in the program for the enemy to be on hard.) <br>

- <p> PlayerOne & PlayerTwo (A system that is implemented in the program to let the player select a default character that is already created for players.) <br>

- <p> PlayerSelection (A system that is implemented in the program to let them have a selection of characters to choose from.) <br>

- <p> TurnBattleMain (The system that runs the code.) <br>

### Iteration 3
During our final iteration, we implemented different visual aspects, added variables and desgins, displayed data information, and also put our battle system in so the player can go against the enemy.

### Test Classes Created
- <p> BattleWinCalTest (Implements a system into the EndCard class to show the total amount of wins that the player has earned.)
- <p> BattleLogicTest (A system that was implemented into the program on how the battle should work.)

### Extra Inputs
- Players can now battle their opponet by attacking and defending. Players can also see when the enemy does damange to them and if they do damange to the enemy. 
- We also added extra visuals inside of our program when it comes to battling our other enemies. During the easy difficult, you battle a bunny, medium you battle a mushroom, and hard you battle a dark creature.
- We also implemented a system to show that the player can save their character stats and can see their saved wins. 



### How to run the program 
1. Navigate to the menu class
2. Press the green play button at the top left program to start playing!
